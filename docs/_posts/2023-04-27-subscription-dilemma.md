The shared subscription dilemma.

Not long ago Netflix announced that all the subscriptions shared by many people using a single account would be penalized. This went with debatable success but indicates the problem. Netflix has lots of financial resources, yet still looks not to leak opportunities for making money. 
Is Computantis a probable solution to seal the leakage of shared subscriptions? It depends. Let me explain.

The main challenge is that the wallet that will uniquely identify the person that is using the service needs hardware to run on. So if we will assume that the owner of the account will always have that hardware with him it is then possible. Ow… hold on…. Do we not carry with us all the time our smartphones?

Assuming that we sell our service only to people having smartphones, which is probably a huge majority of the population that has access to the internet and can access our service such as a streaming platform. Then paying for this incredible loss of eleven people left out of the education we are having hardware for free attached to our client all day and night long.

Knowing that our service client is close to any device that wants access to our system we are going to place on the screen a picture of noisy mesh squares that the smartphone will read and then sign sending to the central node, validating the legitimacy of the client and confirming client location. This verification may only happen when the device from which we want to access data is going to change so our service client is not annoyed by the constant confirmations.

It isn’t easy to be introduced when your system already has thousands of clients, but it is easy to start building your service having in mind that this might someday save you a lot of money and seal the security of your client's accounts.
