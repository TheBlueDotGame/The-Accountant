Not long ago Netflix announced that all the subscriptions shared by many people using a single account would be penalized. This went with debatable success but indicates the problem. Netflix has lots of financial resources, yet still looks not to miss the opportunities for making money. Which is understandable.
Is Computantis a probable solution to seal the leakage of shared subscriptions? It depends. Let me explain.

The main challenge is that the wallet that will uniquely identify the person that is using the service needs hardware to run on. So if we will assume that the owner of the account will always have that hardware with him it is then possible. Ow… hold on…. Do we not carry with us all the time our smartphones?

Assuming that we sell our service only to people having smartphones, which is probably a huge majority of the population with internet access. Then paying for this incredible loss of eleven people left out of the education we are having hardware for free attached to our client all day and night long.

Knowing that our service client is close to any device that wants access to our system we have almost sealed the subscription problem. To confirm that streamed video or any other service resource is accessed only by our client we are going to place on the screen of the device accessing the service data that the smartphone will read using a camera for example and then sign sending to the central node, validating the legitimacy of the client and confirming client location is close to the device. To avoid constant requests to the client to confirm that the device is accessed by the client it might be restricted to only force validation when a device accessing the service is changed which each service can easily validate.

It isn’t easy to change a client's habits, so I would recommend having in mind that identity validation of service clients is crucial not only for security but also for the money making model.
