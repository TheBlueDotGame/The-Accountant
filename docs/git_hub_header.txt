# The Accountant

The accountant is a service that keeps track of transactions between wallets.
Each wallet has its own independent history of transactions. There is a set of rules allowing for transactions to happen.
The accountant is not keeping track of all transactions in a single blockchain but rather allows to keep transactions signed by an authority. A signed transaction is valid transaction only if the issuer and receiver of the transaction are existing within the system.
