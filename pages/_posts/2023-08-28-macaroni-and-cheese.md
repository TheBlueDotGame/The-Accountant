This year (2023) International Association for Cryptologic Research meeting held a talk about ORAM.
Oblivious RAM is a compiler that transforms algorithms in such a way that the resulting algorithms preserve the input-output behaviour of the original algorithm but the distribution of the memory access pattern of the transformed algorithm is independent of the memory access pattern of the original algorithm.
One of the implementations introduced by the researcher during the talk was the MacORAM implementation which contained two distinct features:
1. Mac (message authentication code) - for portions of the schema where the access pattern is time-stampable.
2. AND CHEcking Efficiently and SEcurley - use offline memory checker with amortized 0(1) blow up.

The main reference I would like to make from the Computantis point of view is the way the "Mac and Cheese" solution is securing against the replay attack.
A replay attack is a fairly simple but powerful way to make a lot of mess without putting too much effort into the process of recognizing how the system works.
In the case of the system when participants exchange information of security value this may be the single most efficient vector of an attack.

Let me create a hypothetical but very realistic scenario. Imagine you are running a company that is buying the electricity produced by a house equipped with solar panels. There is a special meter that is equipped with an encrypted client that sends everything to my company and based on that meter I am paying back to the client for received energy. Even thou messages are encrypted hackers can try to record the conversation from the time when the device was producing a lot of power and then replay back to my company the messages claiming compensation in money for faked measurements. This is one of the examples of when a replay attack can make a huge impact on the financial condition of the company. This scam is hard to discover and prove without a proper system in place. 

The computantis solution seals the transactions making the replay attack impossible.
Each data measurement, or any other packet is embedded within an immutable transaction that has a timestamp being part of the transaction digest. This makes each transaction unique, so each one is treated as separate. Repeating the same message many times at once or after some time shows that the message is just a replication and will always be rejected by the central node of the computantis solution  Such messages are not sent to the receiver client and are not part of the blockchain. It saves on traffic to the receiver node and replications are not required to be sealed in the blockchain as it is obvious they are corrupted messages. The computantis can still save or account for those corrupted messages just for a legal case and for the discovery of criminal acts and misbehaviour of the devices.

The transaction in the computantis solution is only valid after the receiver confirms to agree with the data being received and signs the transaction embedding that data. This gives the receiver the possibility to reject any transaction and also makes the transaction sender sure that the receiver hasnâ€™t accepted the same transaction a few times. This makes a reply attack be impossible to do by the sender and the receiver. The transaction is always unique and valid only if is unique and signed by both sides of the transaction. 
The unique transaction is then at the end added to the blockchain only if both sides agree on it by signing it and cannot be altered in the future which is ensured by the computantis blockchain protocol.

Bon apetti.
